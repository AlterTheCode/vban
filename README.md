vban_receptor - Linux command-line VBAN to alsa player
======================================================

&copy; 2015 Beno√Æt Quiniou - quiniouben[at]yahoo(.)fr

vban_receptor is an open-source implementation of VBAN protocol.
It currently takes the form of a Linux command-line player to play a VBAN audio stream to alsa local audio device.
VBAN is a simple audio over UDP protocol proposed by VB-Audio, see [VBAN Audio webpage](http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Voicemeeter/vban.htm).

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

vban_receptor doesn't have a configure script. Nevertheless the makefile is very simple and has some basic variables (CC, LD, STRIP, CROSS_COMPILE, DESTDIR) to define whatever compilation toolchain you wish to use and where you want to install. This will probably evolve in future releases.
So simply use:

    $ make
    # make install

Usage
-----

Invoking vban_receptor without any parameter will give hints on how to use it :

    Usage: vban_receptor [OPTIONS]...

    -i, --ipaddress=IP    : ipaddress to get stream from
    -p, --port=PORT       : port to listen to
    -s, --streamname=NAME : streamname to play
    -q, --quality=ID      : network quality indicator from 0 (low latency) to 4. default is 1
    -h, --help            : display this message
